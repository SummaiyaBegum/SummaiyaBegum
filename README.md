# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Summaiya Begum

A Life Sciences graduate with a background in **Microbiology, Zoology, Applied Nutrition and Public Health**.  
Currently learning to use **Python** and basic bioinformatics tools to understand biological data â€” especially in the context of microbes, antimicrobial resistance, and genomics.

## ðŸ”¬ What Iâ€™m Learning

Working through beginner-level exercises from reliable sources to get comfortable with computational biology. 
These include:

- Reading and writing DNA sequences in FASTA format  
- Calculating GC content  
- Identifying introns and exons  
- Finding restriction enzyme sites  
- Working with small datasets

Each folder in this profile contains exercises I've **practiced**, along with the code, data, and short explanations.  
These exercises are not my own creations â€” they are based on **learning materials from sources such as:**
- [Python for Biologists](https://userpages.fu-berlin.de/digga/p4b.pdf) by Dr. Martin Jones

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Path

The aim is to gradually connect **wet-lab microbiology** with **basic computational analysis** using Python and open bioinformatics resources.  
This profile is simply where I keep track of what Iâ€™ve learned and how Iâ€™m applying it through small coding tasks.
