# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Summaiya Begum

A Life Sciences graduate with a background in **Microbiology, Zoology, and Public Health**.  
Currently learning to use **Python** and basic bioinformatics tools to understand biological data â€” especially in the context of microbes, antimicrobial resistance, and genomics.

## ðŸ”¬ What Iâ€™m Learning

Practicing small exercises from educational sources to build a foundation in computational biology.  
These include:

- Reading and writing DNA sequences in FASTA format  
- Calculating GC content  
- Identifying introns and exons  
- Finding restriction enzyme sites  
- Working with small datasets in Excel and saving them as CSV files  

Each folder in this profile contains exercises **studied and practiced**, along with the code, data, and short explanations.  
These exercises are not my own creations â€” they are based on **learning materials from sources such as:**
- [Python for Biologists](https://pythonforbiologists.com/) by Dr. Martin Jones  
- NCBI Bioinformatics Training Resources   
- Open-access genomics and microbiome tutorials

## ðŸ§« My Undergraduate Thesis

Dissertation explored the **phytochemical and antimicrobial activity** of *Pelargonium gravidans* (rose geranium) extract prepared from micropropagated tissue cultures.  
- Tested against *Staphylococcus aureus* (15 mm inhibition) and *Streptococcus pneumoniae* (18 mm inhibition)  
- Phytochemical screening showed the presence of alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins, and essential oils  
- Data were organized and visualized using Excel  

This experience developed my interest in understanding how natural compounds affect microbial growth and resistance â€” leads to focusing on learning data-based approaches to study microbes more deeply.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Path

The aim is to gradually connect **wet-lab microbiology** with **basic computational analysis** using Python and open bioinformatics resources.  
This profile documents the steps taken while learning â€” exercises completed, concepts understood, and progress made over time.  
It serves as a growing record of how biological questions can be explored through small, structured computational tasks.
